## Project Relaxed Games

A simple game cross platform between mobile and desktop and make sure it would be relaxed (Not Guarantee but atleast i tried) and these for my follow up for getting job as 

## Requirement
TODO: After i create that i determined which after half program are running

## Note Myself

When making these games thing should follow and enforce this as you might one day can be replaced
1. Make Sure it explainable and easy to follow
   **Recommended**: Comment those code and tell why they exist and what purpose for it for sake of if you forget and make it help yourself 
   ***Not Recommended*** : Not Comment but it clear of code self explainable but don't use git as you explained it since it clear git for just revision and if you want added at least summary everything but i force you to use comment on code so it would best.
   **Forbidden** : Not Commenting and etc it just being dick out there
   ***Please Adhere these for sake project***
2. Architecture must be loose couple (if you wonder composition if too vague use Dependency Injection and Instances so it would easy to trace) and SRP **Except** : if need it break it please follow note 1
3. Have fun there since its hell working company and not fun if you dont have fucking documentation at all
4. End of these maybe six month from now (if that happend)


GOOD LUCK ME
